I strung three strands of beads for this bracelet.  The first strand is a combination of heart charms and round, red glass beads spaced with clear AB* seed beads.  The second strand is clear, silver lined E beads (app. 3 mm).  The third strand is simply more of the clear AB seed beads.  This bracelet is not weighty at all.  Since the largest bead I used is only 1\/4&quot;, this bracelet is a good candidate for layering in style.  Wear this simple bracelet with everything from your favorite denim skirt and boots to your most business-like suit.\r\n\r\nBracelet length is app. 7-1\/2&quot;.  The heart toggle is app. 1\/2&quot; across, and the round red beads are app. 1\/4&quot;.\r\n\r\n*AB -- aurora borealis, the &quot;rainbow&quot; finish\r\n\r\nSPECIAL NOTES: This bracelet is made from new components rather than vintage pieces. I use fine beading cable to string my bracelets so that they are durable. All ends are properly hidden, and the crimp beads are secure.  I will err on the side of caution by saying that I can not guarantee this piece is hypoallergenic or lead free.  For those with allergies -- although my home is smoke free, I do have a kitty.\r\n\r\nIf you would like FREE gift wrapping similar to that in the last photo above, let me know in the &quot;Note to Seller&quot; section at check out.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy Bracelets...  http:\/\/www.etsy.com\/shop\/JannisMagpieNest?section_id=10830997\r\n\r\nMy Shop...  http:\/\/www.etsy.com\/shop\/JannisMagpieNest","creation_tsz":1422587487,"ending_tsz":1432951887,"original_creation_tsz":1325454908,"last_modified_tsz":1422587487,"price":"25.00","currency_code":"USD","quantity":1,"tags":["teen girls bracelet","mutl strand jewelry","red bracelet","gift for her","heart bracelet","gift idea","romantic bracelet","heart braclet","stacking bracelet","valentine's day","valentine heart","romantic jewelry","easy close bracelet"],"category_path":["Jewelry","Bracelet","Beaded"],"category_path_ids":[68887482,68888548,69161269],"materials":["silver tone heart toggle","red glass beads","silver tone heart charms","clear glass beads","silver lined glass beads","AB beads","Acculon beading wire"],"shop_section_id":null,"featured_rank":null,"state_tsz":1407942775,"url":"https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/listing\/89545600\/heart-multi-strand-bracelet-clear-and?utm_source=etsysimplespasiteaal&utm_medium=api&utm_campaign=api","views":53,"num_favorers":4,"shipping_template_id":2325965,"processing_min":1,"processing_max":3,"who_made":"i_did","is_supply":"false","when_made":"2000_2009","is_private":false,"recipient":"femmes","occasion":"valentines","style":["Goth","Boho"],"non_taxable":false,"is_customizable":false,"is_digital":false,"file_data":"","language":"en-US","has_variations":false,"used_manufacturer":false},{"listing_id":174338448,"state":"active","user_id":31425065,"category_id":69154275,"title":"Seattle Seahawks Inspired Keychain  550 lb Paracord - Large","description":"Seattle Seahawks Inspired Keychain is made with high quality 550 Parachute Cord.
